    "## Overview  \n",
    "This project attempts to create a model to classify song lyrics by artist. It uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes approach, where songs are treated as unordered collections of words. A variance threshold is applied in order to remove words that have low variance across artists from the corpus. The value of the variance threshold is determined by trying many values and calculating the accuracy using each one, and selecting the appropriate value. TFIDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) is used to weight word counts such that words that are used less commonly used are weighed stronger. The average accuracy achieved with this method is approximately `0.65`~`0.70`.\n",

    "There are three python files included in this directory, which gather and preprocess data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### scrape<span></span>.py\n",
    "This file is the one that gathers the data. It uses the `lyricsgenius` package (available on pip) to scrape lyrics from the `genius.com` website. \n",
    "It requires a configuration file, which is a list of artist names separated by newlines, the first line needs to be an integer representing the max limit of songs to search for per artist.\n",
    "`scrape.py` saves all the song lyrics and metadata for each artist in a file called ArtistName.json\n",
    "\n",
    "##### myGenius<span></span>.py\n",
    "This file contains a class `MyGenius` which is a subclass of the `Genius` class found in the `lyricsgenius` package. It overrides the `search_artist()` method, allowing search results to be ordered by popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### parse_json.py\n",
    "This file converts the `JSON` files output by `scrape.py` into a single `.txt` file that is read in by this notebook. It also does some preprocessing on the data, removing lyrics that are too short, as well as sections belonging to featured artists (which would pollute the data)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Note:\n",
    "Creating `myGenius.py` to order results by popularity, as well as removing featured artist sections in `parse_json.py` gave an initial accuracy increase from approximately `0.49` to `0.63`\n",

    "Here the confusion matrix is constructed. This is one of the most interesting parts of the analysis. Here you can see the results, but also some information about the weaknesses of the algorithm, and the structure of the dataset. The confusion matrix shows the correct classes on the vertical, and the predicted classes on the horizontal. The numbers shown are proportional to the number of songs belonging to the artist on the vertical that were predicted to belong to the artist on the horizontal. Therefore, correct predictions appear on the diagonal. As seen below, there is a strong diagonal trend, however there is a fair amount of unwanted noise on the matrix. \n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is a discussion which justifies the decisions that were made in designing the model and outlines some of the challenges that were encountered.\n",
    "The sections are explored in chronological order of development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variance Threshold vs Stop Words\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic feature selection consists of removing irrelevant or noise features. In this case, removing words that do not meaningfully identify a particualar artist.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The initial approach was using a list of stop words as a filter. This method uses a list of common words that are essentially \"filler\" (e.g. 'the','a','is'...). Then it filters the dataset and removes the common words. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method works, but many stop word lists are based on regular english text bodies. This model required a special filter due to the eccentricity of the text.  \n",
    "Compared to a conventianal text, this dataset had common words that are essentially stop words that do not appear on the list, or words in the stop words list that are very infrequently used. In order to apply a more dynamic word filter, `VarianceThreshold` was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance threshold works by calculating the variance across all documents for each word, and removing all occurences of words with a variance below a threshold value. The next step is to figure out how to determine the threshold value. This was done by sampling at many different threshold values, and calculating the accuracy for each one, and choosing the best value for the current dataset. This can be graphed, as seen above. The initial variance graphs had a clear peak area, which indicates that there is an ideal variance threshold specific to each training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a stop word filter resulted in accuracies around `0.20` - `0.25`. For these test a stop word lists from `nltk` and `sklearn` were tested with similar results.  \n",
    "Adding the variance threshold initially increased the accuracy increased from around `0.30`-`0.35` to `0.45`-`0.49`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After adding TF-IDF after the variance threshold (explained below), the shape of the graph changed significantly. Very low thresholds work better, although still providing better accuracy than no threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sanitization\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the basic data sanitization setup was to scrape lyrics data from `Genius.com` using the lyricsgenius package, which is a python wrapper for the API. lyricsgenius also uses the Genius API to search for songs and artists, but the API does not provide access to actual song lyrics, so it also uses the BeautifulSoup library to scrape the lyrics and deliver json files. After scraping the lyrics, our `parse_json.py` script was used to turn multiple json files into a single text file of tab-separated values, removing non-content data (such as labels) from songs, and also remove any very short or invalid songs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this process, the accuracies were approximately `0.30`-`0.35` without variance thresholding, and approximately `0.45`-`0.49` with variance threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to increase the accuracy a few techniques were applied. Firstly, Many songs contain featured verses, which are lyrics belonging to artists other than the primary artist, this will clearly impact the accuracy poorly. In order to remedy this, the `parse_json.py` script was modified using a regular expression to isolate song sections (verse, bridge, chorus, hook...), and check the section labels before removing them to see whether that section is performed by the target artist, removing sections that are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the `Genius.search_artist()` function in the lyricsgenius package was used to retrieve a fixed number songs for a particular artist, however this function only returns songs in alphabetical order. So for example, a request for 50 songs from a particular artist will return the 50 first songs by alphabetical order. This means that the quality of content in these songs is essentially random. Many may not be actual songs, but interludes, spoken pieces, or notes of some form, and some are foreign translations of songs into other languages. Even if a result is a \"real\" song, it may be a very obscure song that is not reflective of the artist's normal style.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the `Genius.search_artist()` function does not allow searches to be ordered by anything other than alphabetical, the underlying Genius API does support ordering by popularity as well. In order to access this functionality, a file called `myGenius.py` was created, containing the `MyGenius` class. This class is a subclass of the `Genius` class in the lyricsgenius package, and overrides the `search_artist()` function with a version that allows for search results to be sorted by popularity. Popularity is a better sort criteria than alphabetical for this application, because the most popular songs are more likely to have a consistent vocabulary and style, and do not include the low-quality content mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "This updated process that removes featured artist content and sorts by popularity was able to increase popularity from around `0.49` to around `0.63` at best.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzes hip-hop lyrics, under the assumption that artists in this genre tend to use very unique and identifying words often, this can be seen in the earlier table of frequent words. Artists will often use their own name or nickname, the name of their city or neighbourhood, record label, or just unique sounds and words. In the analysis it is seen that there are a large number of words that are uniquely used by a very small subset of artists. In order to leverage this feature of the dataset, TF-IDF is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF works by weighting the word counts such that words that have a high ratio of appearances in a song compared to overall appearances are weighted stronger, and vice versa. This allows these unique words to have a stronger effect on the classification algorithm. It was found to be important not to allow normalization in the TF-IDF algorithm, as that would remove the severity of differently weighted word counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially the TF-IDF transformer had a negative effect on the result. It was discovered that by turning off the default normalization used in TF-IDF in `sklearn` the results showed improvement. This is likely due to the sparseness of feature values and the unbalanced distribution of features. The true reasoning for this will have to be researched more in the future.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using TF-IDF increased the accuracy from around `0.63` to up to around `0.65-0.70`\n"

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall the model proved to have an accuracy of roughly 65-70% on the acquired dataset using a 60-40 training testing split.  \n",
    "The project also provided insight into the similarities between artists and the variety of words that can be found in the domain of artists that we chose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "This section discusses the aspects of the project that need further research and development.  \n",
    "For the evaluation, a more robust evaluation method could be implmented such as k-fold validation. The current accuracy metric is somewhat insightful, but it is not as rigorous a k-fold validation which basically performs the current testing method k times.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the analysis that has been done, better preprocessing algorithms can be investigated.  By looking at the top 5 predictions it is possible to identify outlying song lyrics and analyze the factors that causes the outlier and possibly further sanitize the data or amend the model. A similar analysis can be done with the confusion matrix. By identifying commonly miscatagorized artists, further research can be done to improve the model for the incorrectly identying classes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A main concern is that the TF-IDF and Variance Threshold do not take into consideration the training labels, and cannot weight words counts based on their uniqueness to a particular class. Perhaps further weighting the training data based on the training labels before fitting with Multinomial Naive Bayes with the aim of leveraging those highly unique words would lead to higher accuracy."
